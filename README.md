# Motivation

![Lego Kids](lego-kid.jpeg) Going back in time, when Alan Turing built 
[Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) to perform computation, Alanzo Chruch designed 
[Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) to mathematically compute anything by composing lambda functions (world's smallest programming langauage). 
Soon world got filled with programming languages in both the paradigms and many languages start borrowing each other's concept (sounds familiar?) to only become bloated and un-manageable. 

Fast forward 1977...John Bakus's paper, ["Can programming be liberated from von nuemann style?"](https://github.com/van001/lesscode/blob/master/can-programming-be-liberated.pdf) put it very rightly.

The above article influenced me to dive deep into programming paradigm concepts, specially functional programming and really understand it from the work of those 2 greats.
So begin the journey of [Functional Thinking](https://github.com/van001/lesscode), with few very simple goals in mind - 

- Seek deep understanding of motivation and concepts behind the functional programming, 
without being caught in the programming lanugages nuances / jargon, syntax or even nomenclature. 

- Come up with a language agnostic list of real-world functions (library), which can be implemented in any multi-paradigm language that supports functional programming. 

# Overview

This repo is about my learning of functional programming and coming up with a language agnostic library of functions, which
can be applied to solve many real-world problems.

In functional programming language :
- data is immutable. You compute a new value using pure / im-pure functions.

- you either write pure functions (no [side-effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science))) or functions with side-effects ( writing to logs / screen, reading from file, making a database call , etc). 

- you compose solution / functions by composing other function(s).

- you treat function as a 1st class citizen and pass / return a function to / from another function.

- you use fewer category ( String, List, Object) and provide functions to manipulate / transform those categories.

[lesscode-fp](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp/blob/master/lesscode/src/index.js), is a language agnostic javascript functional library, which define functions to manipulate  String, List & Map / Object categories.
You can implement these functions in any multi-paradigm language that supports functional programming.
It's built using the following functional programming principles :

### Pure functions ### 
Pure functions have no side-effects, are time independent & maintain [referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency), which means, for a given input, you can replace the function with it's output, anytime. 
Think of them as a mathematical function, which for a given input will awlays return the same output.
This also means, a pure function can easily cache ([memoize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)) the value it returns after the execution. This is huge, now that memory / storage is cheap and computation is expensive.

All the functions in lesscode library are pure, unless they are not. Pure functions are named starting with lowercase; uppercase for impure.

```
// appends String to another String and returns a new String
const sappend = str1 => str2 => str1 + str2 

// checks if a value is null or not?
const eqNull = val => (val == null || undefined) ? true : false 

// Find the max of 2 munmers
const max = a => b => Math.max(a,b)
```

### Immutable ###
In functional programming you do not mutate data, instead you compute a new. Also, most FP languages support lazy evaluation,
 which means your function is executed only when it's needed. Isn't it sweet...

 Lesscode adheres to the principle, unless it's a Monad ([see below]https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp#Monad)

```
// appends String to another String and returns a new String
const sappend = str1 => str2 => str1 + str2 
```

### Single input / output ### 
The origin of functional programming, ***[lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)***, only allowed single input/ ouput. While it may not seem practical, currying ([see below](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp#Currying))  allows you to do so. Functional programming treats functions as a 1st class citizen, so you can pass a function as a parameter and return a function as a result.

Lesscode functions accept single parameter; multi-paramter functions are curried.

```
// reverses a List, point-free (see [Data-Last](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp#Data-Last)).
// same as : lreverse =>  lst => lfold(([])(lappend)(lst)
const lreverse => lfold(([])(lappend)

// sappend takes a String as 1st parameter and using currying , 
// returns a function that takes another String as a parameter
// sappend = str1 => ( (str2) => str1 + str2 )
const sappend = str1 => str2 => str1 + str2 
```

### Currying ### 
[Currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) (f(a, b) => f(a)(b)), allows function with multiple parameters to be written as sequence of functions that each take a single parameter. 
Currying allows you to partially apply other options (initializion) and dependencies (injection) on multi-parameter functions.
Currying also allows you to create your own DSL (domain specific language) by partially applying many generic functions and creating a new domain specfic one.

Every function in lesscode library is curried and [point-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming) (where possible).

```
// it splits a String into List based on pattern matching.
// s2List is a curried function. 
const s2List = ptrn => async str => str.split(ptrn)

// suppose your domain breaks Sting into List based on space.
// partially apply s2List, with space and create a new function.
const space2List = s2List(space)

// will break String into List on every whitespace.
space2List('This is cool') // ['This','is','cool']
```

### Data-Last ###
Functions that take more than one parameter,  should accept data as a last parameter. If you are coming from imperative programming paradigm, this might be new to you.
In imperative programming you pass data 1st & options (default values - ring the bell?) later.  Or in the case of object oriented programming (still imperative), 
you manipulate the encapsulated data with function(s), which take additional options. 

In FP, data and functions are separate, hence you build library of functions to work with your data.  

Data last principle makes function [composition](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp#Composition), easier (builder pattern). Also, it allows for a point-free style of composition.

```
// l2String converts, List to String. 
// it takes List (which it will convert to String) as a last parameter.
const l2String = sep => lst => lst.join(sep)
```

### Composition ### 
Crux of any programming paradigm is composition. Composition, allows you to re-use the code (less code ;-))

In functional programming there is no assignment, you just compose functions to produce more specific functions/ solutions. Haskell
has infix composition operator like '.' (for pure function) and '>>= / >>' (for [monadic composition](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp#Monad)). Other multi-paradigm languages like javascript, java etc do not have any such 
operators nor they support infix styling.

Lesscode library provide :
- **$(...)** for pure function composition.
- **$M(...)** for [monadic](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp#Monad) composition. 
- **$E(...)** for [applicative](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp#Applicative) compostion.
- **$3(...)** for [stream](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp#Stream) compition.

So only time you write a multi-parameter function is when you are composing it with $.

```
// coconut machine will take List of coconuts, then slice the top & put a straw.
// same as  : coconutMachine = DropStraw . SliceFromTop 
const coconutMachine = $(DropStraw ,SliceFromTop)

// to copy the content of one file to another (point-free)
const FileCopy = to => $M(FileWrite(utf8)(to), FileRead(utf8))
```
***'$' has a very small foot-print and can be easily spotted to show the composition.***

### Fewer Categories ### 
Unlike, Object Oriented programming, where every class is a new category, functional programming benefits from fewer categories and coming up with domain specific abstractions to solve them generically.

Lesscode library provide funtions to manipulate / transform the following categories : String, List, Map / Object (non mutable). These categories are quiet popular in many programming languages. List,  allows easier work distribution; Map / Object,  allows faster retrieval; String, is a preffered way of storing data.

Lesscode libraray prefixes the name of category for all the category specific functions. This design is by choice.

```
// slices String at the specified position
const sslice  = start => end => str => str.slice(start,end)

// converts String to List, by breaking it with supplied pattern
const s2List = ptrn => str => str.split(ptrn)
```

### Functor ###
Since functional programming is already about abstraction ( what to do, not, how to do), the proliferation of  [Category Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) took it to the next level.

Many of the real-world problems are about :
- transforming one category of things to another,
- achieiving those transformation sequentially or concurrently.

In category theory, Functor is a structure preserving transformation from one category to another. Since functor always produces another functor, composition is trivial.

For e.g : Transforming List of lowercase text to List of uppercase. Transforming List of Strings to List of Hash of Strings.

Lesscode library provide 'lmap' function for the List functor. Using lmap you can transform one List into another. **lmap**, essentially lifts each item from the List, hands it to the function for transformation, then puts it back into a new List.

```
// Map over List to tranform into another List, while preserving the structure (Functor - borrowed from category theory). 
const lmap = func => lst => lst.map(func)

// convert the List of Strings to uppercase
const str = ['neelesh' , 'vaikhary']
const strUpper = lmap(supper)(str)
print(strUpper) // ['NEELESH' , 'VAIKHARY']

// Applying the cocununt machine logic to slice & straw, list of coconuts
const readyCoconut = lmap(coconutMachine)['full coconut', 'full coconut']
// or                lmap($(DropStraw ,SliceFromTop))['full coconut', 'full coconut'] 

print(readyCoconut) // ['strawed sliced coconut', 'strawed sliced coconut']
```

### Monad (endofunctor) ### 
Uptill now we only talked about pure functions but real-world functions have side-effects (hidden data, wrapped context), are in-predictable (fail or different result), or even need sequential execution (one after another). 

Monads, let you do all that. Monads let you write functions that can separate concerns (decorator pattern), allow side effect (IO), introduce sequence. 

Think of monad as a function that wraps all the side-effects and make it a pure and allow composition by passing the value from one to another. In category
theroy jargon, Monads are just a [Monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid_(category_theory)) (Category with single element that can be joined). 

***Monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors - Saunders Mac Lane***

Lesscode  provide some built-in Monads using javascript async (promise). 

**$M(...)** supports [monadic composition](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp#Composition) (instead of a >==> operator or kliesli arrow , as it's called in category theory). 
$ indicates composition, M denotes monad or sequence.

```
// Read content of a file. 
const FileRead = option =>  name => fs.promises.readFile(name, option);

// mondaic composition : copy the content of one file to another (point-free)
const FileCopy = to => $M(FileWrite(utf8)(to), FileRead(utf8))
```

### Applicative ###
While monadic composition execute functions (with side-effects) sequentially, applicatives execute them concurrently. 

Lesscode implements applicative composition using **$E(...)** and accept Primitive / Object / List as a parameter. 
If the paramter is a List, then all the functions are concurrently applied to all the items in the List to produce another List .

$ indicates compostion and E denotes concurrency.

```
// apply max, min concurrently to the list os 2 numbers
$E(sum(3), sum(2))([1,2,4]).then(Print) // [ 3, 4, 6, 4, 5, 7 ]

// make 2 Http call concurrently and return the result as a List
$E(HttpGET())(['https://www.google.com','https://www.yahoo.com']).then(Print)
```

### Stream ###
While monads and applicatives allow for a sequential and concurrent data flow, there is another abstraction that would apply something one after another forever.
Like picking water from one bucket, doing somethng with it and dumping to another, forever. 
I am not sure if there is a name for this in functional programming but I'd like to call it a Stream. 
This is a classic callback pattern.

Lesscode implements stream as **$3**. $ means it's still a composition but 3 denotes that it's airity is 3, i.e it accept 3 parameters (outstream, func, instream)

[Stream example](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp#Stream)

# Examples

## Coding questions
Even though FP langauge libraries provide implementation of many of the high level abstractions like sort, 
linked list etc, they do not provide all the abstractions.

Coding questions span many domains and hence it becomes tricky to provide a single generic library. 

Lesscode libarary provide generefic functions to solve many such coding problems. 

### List 
[Twosum](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp/tree/master/lesscode/examples/algorithms/2sum.js)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

examples
```
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 => [0,1]
nums = [3,3], target = 6 => [0,1]
```

Solution
```
/**
 * Logic is very self explanatory :
 * 1. Transform List to another List by subracting it from the target : lmap(sub)
 * 2. Join the 2 List to obtain matching indices : ljoinIndex
 * 3. Remove dupes - [[1,2], [2,1]] => [[1,2]] : lcollapse
 * 4. Discard self - [[0,0]] => []

**/

const {
    $M, 
    sub, 
    eqNot,
    comma, s2List, 
    lcollapse, llift2, lmap, lflat, lfilter, ljoinIndex, 
    Print,
} = require('lesscode-fp')

const target = process.argv[3]
const nums = s2List(comma)(process.argv[2].slice(1,-1))

// Remove self : [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 1, 2 ], [ 2, 1 ] ] => [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 2, 1 ] ]
const ldropSelf = lfilter(llift2(eqNot))

// Transform List to sublist with subtraction
const subList = lmap(sub(target))(nums)

// [3,3] / 6 =>  [1,1]
$M(lflat, ldropSelf, lcollapse, ljoinIndex(subList))(nums) 
```
The above solution will work for more than 1 too. The time complexity is still the same O(N), but the solution is neat and fully composable.
This is the beauty of functional programming. Once you build a domain specific library, it is all about simple composing.

## Real-world 

Many of the real-world problems involve :
- processing data sequentially / concurrently.
- processing synchronously / asynchronously. 
- feeding bulk / continious stream of data.

### Sequential
Doing bunch of things one after another, like copying content of one file to another.

input.txt 
```
writing less-code is cool...
```

output.txt 
```
writing less-code is cool...
```

```
const {
    $M,                       // Composition
    FileRead, FileWrite,      // IO Monad
} = require('lesscode-fp')

const In = process.argv[2]
const Out = process.argv[3]
$M(FileWrite(utf8)(Out), FileRead(utf8))(In)
```

### Concurrent 

Doing bunch of things concurrently, also tolerating failures instead of aborting on error (if a file download fails it is ok, just write the error).

**[Image Download](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp/tree/master/lesscode/examples/image-download)**

Download list of images specified in a file and write metadata(url, size, hash) to the specified output file.

```

```
// Lesscode-fp
const {
    linebreak, utf8, newline, // Strings
    hash,                     // math
    l2String, s2List,         // List
    mget, mgettwo,            // Map
    $M, $E,                   // Composition
    Print,                    // Monad 
    FileRead, FileWrite,      // IO Monad
    HttpGET                   // IO Monad
} = require('lesscode-fp')

const LogData = name => async data => `${name} ${mgettwo('headers')('content-length')} ${hash('sha256')(mget('data'))}`
const LogErorr = name => async err => `${name} 0  ${escape(err)}`

// processURL :: String -> String
const ProcessURL = name => $M(LogData(name), HttpGET())(name).catch(LogErorr(name))

const In = process.argv[2]
const Out = process.argv[3]
// Main pipeline. Classic mix of sequence ($M - monad) & concurrency ( $E - applicative)
$M(FileWrite(utf8)(Out),l2String(newline), $E(ProcessURL), s2List(linebreak), FileRead(utf8))(In).catch(Print)
```
### Stream ###

Sometimes, input is a continious **stream** of data or needs to be handled as stream coz of size. 

**[File Streaming](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp/tree/master/lesscode/examples/file-streaming)**

Stream content of a text file, convert to uppercase then write back to another stream (output file).

input.txt (the real file may be huge...)
```
this text is all lowercase. please turn it into to uppercase.
```

output.txt
```
THIS TEXT IS ALL LOWERCASE. PLEASE TURN IT INTO TO UPPERCASE.
```

```
const { 
    utf8, 
    suppercase,
    $3, 
    FileStreamIn, FileStreamOut
} = require('lesscode-fp')

const is = FileStreamIn(utf8)(process.argv[2])
const os = FileStreamOut(utf8)(process.argv[3])

/**
Streaming pipeline. 
Classic example of doing pure function composition inside 2 im-pure (Monads),
which also happens to be stream.
Stream, also allows monadic composition, since it converts pure to moand, internally.
**/
$3(os)(suppercase)(is)
```
